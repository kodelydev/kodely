## Difference between Roo Code and Cline

We're doing our best to combine the best of both worlds. Kodely is a superset of both Roo Code and Cline. It has the best features of both, and we're working on making it even better. 

No need to fiddle with API keys, Kodely ships with the latest AI models plugged in, including Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Kodely is a direct fork from Roo Code, but also includes the following features from Cline (and more):

- MCP Server Marketplace: Easily find, and use MCP servers to extend the agent capabilities.
- System notifications: Get notified when the agent is done with a task.
- Easy model connection: with bigger free tier.
